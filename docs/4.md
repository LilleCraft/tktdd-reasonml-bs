## Transition

While the types defined in the previously make illegal states unrepresentable, they don't enforce any rules about how to transition from one state into another. A state transition should be a function that takes a current Score and the winner of a ball and returns a new Score. More formally, it should have the type `(Score, Player) => Score`.

You must now be able to implement missing tests. We will apply Test-Driven Development following the Red/Green/Refactor cycle, using Jest. It's possible thanks to bs bindings [bs-jest](https://github.com/glennsl/bs-jest).

Refactoring transition functions should be quite easy following the types we have designed.
