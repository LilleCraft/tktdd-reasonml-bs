## Consideration about Points

#### Naive point attempt with a type alias

```Ocaml
type point = int;
```

This easily enables you to model some of the legal point values:

```Ocaml
let p : point = 15;
let p : point = 30;
```

It looks good so far, but how do you model love? It's not really an integer. Still, both players start with love, so it's intuitive to try to model love as 0 ...It's a hack, but it works. But your illegal values are not unrepresentable :

```Ocaml
let p : point = 1000;
let p : point = -20;
```

For a 32-bit integer, this means that we have four legal representations (0, 15, 30, 40), and 4,294,967,291 illegal representations of a tennis point. Clearly this doesn't meet the goal of making illegal states unrepresentable. ლ(ಠ_ಠლ)

#### Second point attempt with a variant

You may see that love, 15, 30, and 40 aren't numbers, but rather labels. No arithmetic is performed on them. It's easy to constrain the domain of points with a variant

```OCaml
type point =
  | Love
  | Fifteen
  | Thirty
  | Forty;
```

A Point value isn't a score. A score is a representation of a state in the game, with a point to each player. You can model this with a record:

```OCaml
type pointsData = {
  playerOne: point,
  playerTwo: point
};
```

Exemple

```OCaml
let s1 = {playerOne: Love, playerTwo: Love};
let s2 = {playerOne: Fifteen, playerTwo: Love};
let s3 = {playerOne: Thirty, playerTwo: Love};
```
