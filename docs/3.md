## Final attempt at a point type

While this enables you to keep track of the score when both players have less than forty points, the following phases of a game still remain:

- One of the players have forty points.
- Deuce.
- Advantage to one of the players.
- One of the players won the game.

You can design the first of these with another record type:

```OCaml
type fortyData = {
  player: player, /* The player who have forty points */
  otherPlayerPoint: point
};
```

For instance, this value indicates that PlayerOne has forty points, and PlayerTwo has Love :

```OCaml
let fd : fortyData = {player: PlayerOne, otherPlayerPoint: Love};
```

This is a legal score. Other values of this type exist, but none of them are illegal.
