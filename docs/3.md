## Designing score type

Now you have two distinct types, PointsData and FortyData, that keep track of the score at two different phases of a tennis game. You still need to model the remaining three phases, and somehow turn all of these into a single type. This is an undertaking that can be surprisingly complicated in C# or Java, but is trivial to do with a variant:

```OCaml
type score =
| Points(pointsData)
| Forty(fortyData)
| Deuce
| Advantage(player)
| Game(player);
```

As an example, the game starts with both players at love:

```OCaml
let startScore : score = Points({playerOne: Love, playerTwo: Love});
```

PlayerOne has forty points, and PlayerTwo has thirty points, you can create this value:

```OCaml
let anotherScore : score = Forty({player: PlayerTwo, otherPlayerPoint:Thirty });
```

This model of the tennis score system enables you to express all legal values, while making illegal states unrepresentable.

```OCaml
/* All exemple above don't work */
let impossibleScore1 : score = Points({playerOne: Seven, playerTwo: Eleven});
let impossibleScore2 : score = Points({playerOne: Forty, playerTwo: Forty});
let impossibleScore3 : score = Forty({player: PlayerTwo, otherPlayerPoint:Forty });
```

These types govern what can be stated in the domain, but they don't provide any rules for how values can transition from one state to another.
