## Another attempt at a point type

What happens if players are evenly matched?

```OCaml
let even = {playerOne: Forty, playerTwo: Forty};
```

_Forty-forty_ isn't a valid tennis score; it's called _deuce_.

If you're into [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly), you prefer using the ubiquitous language of the domain. When the tennis domain language says that it's not called forty-forty, but deuce, the code should reflect that.

#### Designing Point Datas

The love-love, fifteen-love, etc. values that you can represent with the above PointsData type are all valid. Only when you approach the boundary value of forty do problems appear. A solution is to remove the offending Forty case from Point. (⊙_☉)

At this point, it may be helpful to recap what we have :

```OCaml
type player =
  | PlayerOne
  | PlayerTwo;

type point =
  | Love
  | Fifteen
  | Thirty;

type pointsData = {
  playerOne: point,
  playerTwo: point
};
```

### Final attempt at a point type

While this enables you to keep track of the score when both players have less than forty points, the following phases of a game still remain:

- One of the players have forty points.
- Deuce.
- Advantage to one of the players.
- One of the players won the game.

You can design the first of these with another record type:

```OCaml
type fortyData = {
  player: player, /* The player who have forty points */
  otherPlayerPoint: point
};
```

For instance, this value indicates that PlayerOne has forty points, and PlayerTwo has Love :

```OCaml
let fd : fortyData = {player: PlayerOne, otherPlayerPoint: Love};
```

This is a legal score. Other values of this type exist, but none of them are illegal.
