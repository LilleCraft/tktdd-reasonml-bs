## Another attempt at a point type

What happens if players are evenly matched?

```OCaml
let even = {playerOne: Forty, playerTwo: Forty};
```

_Forty-forty_ isn't a valid tennis score; it's called _deuce_.

If you're into [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly), you prefer using the ubiquitous language of the domain. When the tennis domain language says that it's not called forty-forty, but deuce, the code should reflect that.

#### Designing Point Datas

The love-love, fifteen-love, etc. values that you can represent with the above PointsData type are all valid. Only when you approach the boundary value of forty do problems appear. A solution is to remove the offending Forty case from Point. (⊙_☉)

At this point, it may be helpful to recap what we have :

```OCaml
type player =
  | PlayerOne
  | PlayerTwo;

type point =
  | Love
  | Fifteen
  | Thirty;

type pointsData = {
  playerOne: point,
  playerTwo: point
};
```
